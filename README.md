# sass-watch-wp
A small script that runs SASS watch for Wordpress.

If you write some SASS code for wordpress, this Script will help you to watch your files and place them to the right place.

So style.scss will be placed one level above (../) and all other files go to (../css/).


Just run ./sass-watch-wp-sh inside your scss folder.
